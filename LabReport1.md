We begin by using this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download the mac version and proceed to follow the installation instructions.

Once done, you should get the following screen once the application is opened. It won't look exactly like this, but do explore and play around with the settings. Unlike old text editors like Vim which require PlugIns using a text file, installing extensions (added features contributors made) are as easy as clicking a button!
